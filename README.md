# ConvNet
This is a convolutional neural network application in Python for image classification. For training data, the `ImageScraper` class pulls images off of Google Images using the Google Custom Search API. It then saves those images in the folder corresponding to the search term.

The actual CNN has 1 convolutional layer, 1 pooling layer, and 1 hidden fully connected layer implemented.
